# texttospeech
 convert your text file into audio


 This is a python program to convert text into speech.
 I've used the python library "pyttsx3" for setting a voice for our program
 
 * install the library pyttsx3 - (pip install pyttsx3)
 before you run the code
 
 The input can be taken from "speech.txt" file or from the console.
 
 ** NOTE: This application/program will be updated/enhanced/evolved/upgraded in the near future **
